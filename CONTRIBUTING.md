Contributing to Athena Create API
We are thrilled to invite you to be a part of the Athena Create API project. This is not just an open source project but a community initiative, and we value your expertise and creativity. To show our appreciation, we have instituted a unique rewards system that directly compensates contributors from the revenue generated by the Athena Create API API.

Why Contribute
Contributing to Athena Create API not only enhances your skills and profile but also comes with financial rewards. When you contribute code, documentation, or any form of improvement to the Athena Create API project, you are adding value. As such, we believe it's only fair that you share in the rewards.

Rewards Program
Here's how the Athena Create API Rewards Program works:

Submit a Pull Request: This can be a code enhancement, bug fix, documentation update, new feature, or any improvement to the project.

Review and Approval: Our team will review your contribution. If it gets approved and merged, you become eligible for the rewards program.

Revenue Share: Once your pull request is merged, you will receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the Athena Create API API. The percentage will be determined based on the significance and impact of your contribution.

This means you're not just contributing to an open source project; you're becoming a part of the Athena Create API ecosystem. Your efforts can yield ongoing benefits as the Athena Create API API grows and evolves.

Becoming a Paid API
As part of our growth strategy, we will be deploying Athena Create API as a Paid API. The revenue generated from this API will not only sustain and further the project, but also fund the rewards program.
